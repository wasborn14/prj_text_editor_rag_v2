## Technical Architecture Evolution

### Current Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Editor**: CodeMirror 6 with Markdown support
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with GitHub OAuth
- **AI**: Multi-provider (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, Google AI)
- **GitHub**: Octokit.js for repository management

### Planned Technical Additions
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime for live collaboration
- **Search**: pgvector + OpenAI embeddings for semantic search
- **Webhooks**: GitHub App for bidirectional sync
- **Background Jobs**: Vercel Edge Functions or Supabase Edge Functions
- **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for images and large files
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics + Sentry for error tracking

## Success Metrics

### Phase 3B Success Criteria
- ✅ Real-time bidirectional sync (GitHub ↔ Web)
- ✅ Conflict resolution with 95%+ success rate
- ✅ Sync latency under 5 seconds for most operations

### Phase 4 Success Criteria
- ✅ Semantic search across repository content
- ✅ AI chat with accurate file citations
- ✅ Context-aware suggestions improve editing efficiency by 30%

### Long-term Goals
- Support for 1000+ file repositories
- Sub-second search response times
- 99.9% uptime for production deployments
- Seamless experience matching VSCode functionality

## Development Notes

### Key Implementation Learnings
1. **Supabase RLS**: Multi-tenant isolation works well for user data separation
2. **GitHub API**: Rate limiting requires careful batching for large repositories
3. **Real-time Updates**: UseEffect dependency optimization crucial for performance
4. **Authentication Flow**: Direct redirect to homepage works better than callback routes

### Technical Debt to Address
1. Clean up debug logging in production builds
2. Implement proper TypeScript strict mode compliance
3. Add comprehensive error boundaries
4. Optimize bundle size with tree shaking

### Risk Mitigation
- **GitHub API Limits**: Implement request batching and caching
- **Database Performance**: Use proper indexing and query optimization
- **Real-time Sync**: Handle network failures gracefully with retry logic
- **Data Consistency**: Implement transaction-based updates where needed
